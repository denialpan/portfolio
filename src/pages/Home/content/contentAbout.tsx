                    I am currently an undergraduate software engineer. I love writing code for all kinds of things, especially from scratch as it gives me ample opportunity to learn new concepts at their fundamental level.

                    C++ is currently the lowest level I confidently work in. It is a good balance of low level system interactions and direct memory management, while not being superfluous as C or assembly. Languages like Python and Java help me to quickly prototype ideas and algorithms.

                    Much of my work is built trying to use as minimal libraries or third-party packages as much as possible. This is an arbitrary goal that encourages me to learn at the lowest level before specifics are abstracted away.

                <div class="description-text custom-divider-bottom">
                    By restricting myself this way, I come up with solutions to writing modular efficient code and carefully deciding on using third-party tools if they also follow the same philosophy. Prominent examples can be found in my Projects page, with a listing of languages and frameworks that are used.

                    A showcase or project should be efficient as it is enjoyable to look at and use. Much of my work follows a consistent theme depending on its purpose, whether it be a Windows-specific program adhering to WPF/Winforms tradition, or as simple as this portfolio page, giving users the choice to view on desktop or mobile, with accessibility in theming for the eyes, while still being incredibly lightweight and fast to load.
