    "Here's a true short story #1. There was a time in my highschool where someone found out that you could take the install .exe for the cloud gaming service \"GeForce NOW\" and extract it with 7zip and open it without install permissions. This more or less revolutionized playing games in the computer lab once your work was done. People were playing GTA 5, a few were in CS:GO comps, and I knew a kid hopping on Rust to check his base or something. The school later blocked this loophole about a year later maybe, or if not, definitely the .exe install has changed by now.",
    "Here's a true short story #2. The highschool had what my friends called a \"star folder\" on the school computer network, and it could be accessed from any computer. It would essentially serve as a hivemind of completely random files: portable games, pirated movies, audios. It was in a sense basically the school's own repository of the darkweb."
